- Book availability tracking
- Book status monitoring (available, issued, returned)
- Category-wise book organization

### 3. Book Issuance System
- Automated book issuance process
- Due date tracking
- Overdue book monitoring
- Return book functionality
- Issue history tracking

### 4. Dashboard Features

2. System assigns unique IDs to books
3. Books are categorized and stored in database
4. Real-time availability updates

### 3. Book Issuance Workflow
1. Student requests book issuance
2. System checks book availability
3. Records issue date and due date
4. Updates book status
5. Sends confirmation to student

### 4. Return Process
1. Student initiates return
2. System verifies book condition
3. Updates book status to available
4. Records return in history
